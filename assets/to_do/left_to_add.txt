 
First:

unversioned per mod instead of global
Engine pak making compression variants (diff types, in one run), defaults to compressed rn

loose file copying/og_game file tracker to alleviate loose modding issues
Mod Release Creator

iterative mod testing, should probably not clear working dir, 
and do a hash check for if files are diff, 
and delete any not in the other dirs that were removed since last mod building
maybe also for loose file modding copying

more Doc strings
better Type hints
Logging/log file creation
Switch to pathlib from strings

Later:
github action pylinting
poetry
unit tests
