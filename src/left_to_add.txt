compressed and not  compressed for repak, engine, and unrealpak

packing logic for the following:
    loose file done except add mod name folder
    engine pak done except compression
    unreal pak
    repak

loose mod uninstalling can be tricky if the files used change
what if engine pak but one with and one without compression
